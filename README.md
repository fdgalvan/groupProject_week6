Hot Travels 

Overview: 
Are you looking to escape for a couple of days and experience new grounds in a different city?
We have created a website that is the solution to your subpar weekends!
On our website, you are able to search for surrounding cities and states you're interested in visiting for any quick and last-minute plans! All of this is available to you through your fingertips within just a couple of clicks and a search for your next adventure. You'll be informed about any Sports Events, Concerts, or Local Events happening in that very state/city, with a current update of the current weather forecast to assure you are on your way to a pleasurable experience.
